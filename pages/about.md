I'm a Lead Front End Developer and Web Designer with 10 years experience building websites, apps, and digital products for enterprise clients, agencies, and startups.

I've worked with industry leaders like Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Ogilvy, McCann, Coldwell Banker, Century 21, Better Homes and Gardens, GSK, and Novartis. My web design work has been featured in Photoshop User magazine. I currently work at Realogy, a leading global franchisor of some of the most recognized brands in real estate. I also work part-time at Palantir, a software company founded by Peter Thiel that specializes in big data analytics.
