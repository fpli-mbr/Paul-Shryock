When optimizing websites for search engines, following a few solid best practices goes a long way.

## Page titles

Make sure each page has a unique, descriptive `<title>` tag that accurately describes what the page is about, between 40 and 70 characters. Choose a keyword that you would like this page to rank for, and include that word in the title, in a natural way.

## Descriptions

Also make sure each page has a unique `<meta>` description tag which further explains what will be found on the page, between 130 and 155 characters in length. Remember to include your keyword in the description once.

## URL slugs

Use short, human-readable URL slugs that include the keyword.

## Semantic document structure, image alt attributes

You should also use semantic HTML markup to structure each page document with correct heading levels, and include descriptive `alt` attributes for `<img>` elements.

## Internal hyperlinks

You should also create relevant hyperlinks between your pages which use descriptive `<a>` element text, including keywords you would like those pages to rank for.
