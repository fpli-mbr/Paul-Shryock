Do you want more customers to find your website on page 1 of Google? In order to rank higher and reach more people, you need to [optimize each page for search engines]({{ site.permalink }}/seo-basics-2016/). This starts with writing better SEO page titles.

## Include A Relevant Keyword Or Keyphrase

If your goal is to page your page rank highly in search engines for a specific keyword or keyphrase, include it in the page title. If you can place it at the beginning of the title, that is ideal. But including it anywhere will draw users to your page title, because it’s exactly what they searched for.

##Make Every Page Title Unique

Make sure that the title of each page on your website accurately describes the content of that page. Your page titles should not all be the name of your company or organization.

They should be descriptive and straightforward. You need to accurately state what the page is about, as this will help people to find what they’re looking for.

Remember, this is the first thing people see on search engines. It needs to catch their eye, or else they will keep scrolling.

## Use An Appropriate Title Length

The ideal length for your page titles is between 40 and 70 characters. Anything longer gets cut and replaced with an ellipsis (`…`). Anything below this range wastes valuable space you could use to attract visitors.

Don’t underestimate the importance of how long your page title looks on search engine results pages.

## Improving Your Page Titles Will Help Your SEO

**So remember:** For each page on your website, choose a keyword or keyphrase that you want to rank highly for. Include it in your page title to show users that your content is what they’re searching for. Make each page title unique, and accurately describe the information on each page. And make use of the available space without going past 70 characters. Using these principles, you will start to write better SEO page titles and rank higher in search engines.
