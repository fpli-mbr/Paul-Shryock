I worked with Paul as a freelance digital art director at Ogilvy Commonhealth in Parsippany. He’s a sought after, talented digital designer and art director with excellent computer AND people skills who also happens to be a talented fine artist. A total gentleman with a quiet demeanor, Paul is an absolute pleasure to work with!
