Paul was an almost immediate value-add to our efforts and has been a consistent source of high-quality support and experienced work over the past few months. We’ve especially valued his curiosity about best-in-class architecture design, as well as his attention to detail on all requests. In addition, he brings a calm demeanor and attitude to his work that is quite valuable in our chaotic environment. It’s been great having him work with the team&mdash;we look forward to more collaboration.
